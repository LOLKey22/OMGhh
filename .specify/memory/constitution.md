# OMGhh Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality Standards (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
All code MUST maintain high quality standards through mandatory practices:
- Consistent code formatting and linting enforced via automated tools
- Clear, self-documenting code with meaningful variable and function names
- Comprehensive inline documentation for all public APIs and complex logic
- Code reviews required for all changes with at least one approver
- No dead code, commented-out blocks, or TODO comments in production branches

**Rationale**: High code quality reduces technical debt, improves maintainability, and ensures team productivity remains high as the codebase grows.

### II. Testing Standards (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Comprehensive testing coverage is mandatory across all development phases:
- Test-Driven Development (TDD) for all new features: Tests written → Approved → Fail → Implement
- Minimum 80% code coverage for unit tests, 70% for integration tests
- All functions MUST have corresponding unit tests with edge case coverage
- End-to-end tests required for all user-facing workflows and critical business logic
- Performance regression tests for all performance-critical components

**Rationale**: Robust testing prevents regressions, ensures reliability, and enables confident refactoring and deployment.

### III. User Experience Consistency
All user interfaces and interactions MUST provide consistent, intuitive experiences:
- Unified design system with consistent visual patterns, spacing, and typography
- Standardized interaction patterns across all interfaces (CLI, web, API)
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA minimum) for all user-facing components
- Error messages MUST be clear, actionable, and user-friendly
- Response times under 200ms for interactive elements, under 2s for data operations

**Rationale**: Consistent UX reduces cognitive load, improves user satisfaction, and decreases support burden.

### IV. Performance Requirements
All components MUST meet strict performance criteria:
- Page load times under 3 seconds on standard broadband connections
- API response times under 500ms for 95th percentile of requests
- Memory usage monitoring with alerts for >80% utilization
- Database queries optimized with proper indexing and execution plans
- Automated performance testing in CI/CD pipeline with failure thresholds

**Rationale**: Performance directly impacts user satisfaction, operational costs, and system scalability.

## Quality Gates

All code changes MUST pass through mandatory quality gates before deployment:
- Automated linting, formatting, and security scanning
- Full test suite execution with 100% pass rate
- Performance benchmarks within acceptable thresholds
- Accessibility validation for UI components
- Code review approval from designated maintainers

## Development Workflow

Standard development practices ensure consistent delivery:
- Feature branches with descriptive naming conventions (e.g., feature/user-auth, fix/memory-leak)
- Commit messages following conventional commit format
- Pull request templates with mandatory checklist completion
- Continuous integration runs all tests and quality checks
- Staged deployment through development → staging → production environments

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices and policies:
- All team members MUST comply with these principles
- Constitution amendments require majority team approval and version increment
- Compliance violations MUST be addressed before code deployment
- Regular constitution review scheduled quarterly for relevance and effectiveness

**Version**: 1.0.0 | **Ratified**: 2025-09-22 | **Last Amended**: 2025-09-22
