# API Contract: GET /api/notes

**Endpoint**: `GET /api/notes`  
**Purpose**: Retrieve all notes in reverse chronological order  
**Method**: GET  
**Authentication**: None required

## Request

### Headers
```
Accept: application/json
```

### Query Parameters
None

### Request Body
None (GET request)

## Response

### Success Response (200 OK)
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "note_1695456789123_0.456",
      "title": "Shopping List",
      "content": "Milk, Bread, Eggs, Cheese",
      "createdAt": "2025-09-23T10:33:09.123Z",
      "updatedAt": "2025-09-23T10:33:09.123Z"
    },
    {
      "id": "note_1695456720000_0.789",
      "title": "Meeting Notes",
      "content": "Discuss project timeline and deliverables",
      "createdAt": "2025-09-23T10:32:00.000Z",
      "updatedAt": "2025-09-23T10:32:00.000Z"
    }
  ],
  "count": 2
}
```

### Error Response (500 Internal Server Error)
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "FILE_READ_ERROR",
    "message": "Unable to read notes data. Please try again.",
    "details": "Internal server error occurred while reading notes file"
  }
}
```

## Behavior Specifications

### Ordering
- Notes MUST be returned in reverse chronological order (newest first)
- Ordering based on `createdAt` timestamp
- Empty array returned if no notes exist

### Performance Requirements
- Response time MUST be <500ms for up to 1000 notes
- Memory usage MUST be <10MB during processing
- File I/O operations MUST complete within 200ms

### Edge Cases
1. **Empty notes file**: Returns `{"success": true, "data": [], "count": 0}`
2. **Corrupted data file**: Returns 500 error with recovery guidance
3. **File not found**: Creates new file and returns empty array
4. **Large number of notes**: Maintains performance requirements up to 1000 notes

## Test Scenarios

### Happy Path
1. **Given** notes file exists with 2 notes
2. **When** GET /api/notes is called
3. **Then** response contains both notes in reverse chronological order
4. **And** response time is <500ms

### Empty State
1. **Given** no notes exist
2. **When** GET /api/notes is called  
3. **Then** response contains empty array with count 0
4. **And** success flag is true

### Error Handling
1. **Given** notes file is corrupted
2. **When** GET /api/notes is called
3. **Then** response contains error message
4. **And** HTTP status is 500
5. **And** error code indicates file read failure

## Implementation Notes

### Caching Strategy
- No caching required for MVP (file-based storage is cache)
- Consider in-memory caching if performance testing reveals needs

### Concurrent Access
- Single-user application: no concurrency concerns
- File locking not required for read operations

### Monitoring
- Log response times for performance tracking
- Monitor file size for storage usage
- Track error rates for reliability metrics

## Constitutional Compliance

✅ **Performance**: <500ms response time requirement  
✅ **UX Consistency**: Predictable data format and error handling  
✅ **Code Quality**: Clear contract specification for implementation  
✅ **Testing**: Comprehensive test scenarios defined
