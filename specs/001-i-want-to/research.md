# Research: Simple Notes App

**Phase**: 0 - Technical Research  
**Generated**: 2025-09-23  
**Input**: Feature specification analysis and technical context

## Architecture Decisions

### Frontend Architecture
**Decision**: Vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript (no frameworks)
**Rationale**: 
- Aligns with constitutional requirement for minimal UI
- Reduces complexity and load time for simple two-function app
- Easier to maintain without framework dependencies
- Meets <3s page load requirement easily

### Backend Architecture  
**Decision**: Node.js with Express.js
**Rationale**:
- Lightweight and fast for simple API requirements
- JavaScript ecosystem consistency between frontend/backend
- Built-in JSON handling ideal for note data structure
- Express provides minimal but sufficient web server capabilities

### Data Persistence Strategy
**Decision**: Two-phase approach
1. **Phase 1**: In-memory array for rapid development/testing
2. **Phase 2**: JSON file persistence for production use

**Rationale**:
- Meets offline requirement (no external database dependency)
- JSON format natural for note data (title, content, timestamp)
- File system persistence sufficient for local single-user app
- Allows TDD approach: start simple, evolve to persistent storage

### Performance Strategy
**Decision**: Synchronous file operations with error handling
**Rationale**:
- Small data size (<1000 notes) makes sync operations acceptable
- Simpler error handling and debugging
- Meets <500ms API response requirement for expected scale
- Consider async optimization if performance testing reveals issues

## Technology Validation

### Constitutional Compliance Check
✅ **Code Quality**: ESLint/Prettier easily integrated  
✅ **Testing**: Jest for backend, Playwright for E2E coverage achievable  
✅ **UX Consistency**: Vanilla CSS allows full design control  
✅ **Performance**: Lightweight stack meets all timing requirements  

### Risk Assessment
**Low Risk**: 
- Well-established technology stack
- Simple data model and operations
- No external dependencies or APIs

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- File corruption: Backup strategy and validation
- Large datasets: Implement note count limits (~1000 max)
- Browser compatibility: Target modern browsers (ES6+ support)

## API Design Principles

### RESTful Approach
- `GET /api/notes` - Retrieve all notes (reverse chronological)
- `POST /api/notes` - Create new note
- Input validation and error responses per constitutional standards

### Data Format
```json
{
  "id": "unique-timestamp-based-id",
  "title": "string (required, non-empty)",
  "content": "string (required, non-empty)", 
  "createdAt": "ISO 8601 timestamp",
  "updatedAt": "ISO 8601 timestamp"
}
```

### Error Handling Strategy
- Client-side validation for immediate feedback
- Server-side validation as authoritative source
- Clear, actionable error messages per UX requirements
- Graceful degradation for file system issues

## Development Workflow

### TDD Implementation Order
1. **Models**: Note validation and data structure
2. **Services**: File operations and note management
3. **API**: HTTP endpoints with error handling
4. **Frontend**: UI components with validation
5. **Integration**: End-to-end user workflows

### Performance Testing Strategy
- Unit tests: Individual function performance
- Integration tests: API response time validation
- E2E tests: Full workflow timing including UI rendering
- Load testing: Multiple note operations

## Security Considerations

### Input Validation
- XSS prevention: HTML encoding for note content display
- Input length limits: Prevent excessive memory usage
- File path validation: Ensure notes.json integrity

### Local Security
- No authentication required (per specification)
- File system permissions for notes.json
- Content Security Policy for frontend

## Conclusion

Architecture supports all functional and constitutional requirements with minimal complexity. Technology choices prioritize simplicity, performance, and maintainability while enabling comprehensive testing coverage.
