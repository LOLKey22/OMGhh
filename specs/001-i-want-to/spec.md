# Feature Specification: Simple Notes App

**Feature Branch**: `001-i-want-to`  
**Created**: 2025-09-22  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I want to build a very simple Notes app with only two functions. Purpose: Let users jot down quick notes. Users: No login, anyone can use it locally. Core features: 1. Add a note with a title and content. 2. View all notes in a list. Success criteria: The app must be simple and fast. Notes should persist between sessions (use local storage or a simple database). Prevent saving empty notes. Display notes in reverse chronological order (newest first). Constraints from constitution: Keep the UI minimal and responsive. Ensure instant feedback when saving a note."

## Execution Flow (main)
```

   ‚Üí Description provided: Simple Notes app with two core functions
2. Extract key concepts from description ‚úì
   ‚Üí Actors: Local users (no authentication)
   ‚Üí Actions: Add note, view notes list
   ‚Üí Data: Notes with title and content, timestamps
   ‚Üí Constraints: Minimal UI, persistence, fast response
3. For each unclear aspect: ‚úì
   ‚Üí All aspects clearly specified
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section ‚úì
   ‚Üí Clear user flows identified
5. Generate Functional Requirements ‚úì
   ‚Üí All requirements testable and specific
6. Identify Key Entities ‚úì
   ‚Üí Note entity identified with clear attributes
7. Run Review Checklist ‚úì
   ‚Üí No implementation details, no ambiguities
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
A user wants to quickly capture thoughts, reminders, or ideas in a simple note-taking application that works immediately without setup or login. They need their notes to be available whenever they return to the app.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the app is opened for the first time, **When** user creates a note with title "Shopping List" and content "Milk, Bread, Eggs", **Then** the note is saved and appears in the notes list
2. **Given** several notes exist, **When** user opens the app, **Then** all notes are displayed with newest notes at the top
3. **Given** user is creating a new note, **When** they attempt to save with empty title and content, **Then** the save action is prevented and user receives feedback
4. **Given** user creates a note, **When** they close and reopen the app, **Then** the note persists and remains visible
5. **Given** user is typing in the note form, **When** they complete an action (save/cancel), **Then** they receive immediate visual feedback

### Edge Cases
- What happens when user tries to save a note with only whitespace in title/content? (Should be treated as empty)
- How does the system handle extremely long note titles or content? (Should accept but may need UI considerations)
- What happens if the user's device storage is full? (Graceful error handling required)
- How does the app behave with no existing notes? (Should show empty state with guidance)

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to create new notes without authentication or registration
- **FR-002**: System MUST require both title and content fields to have non-empty, non-whitespace values before saving
- **FR-003**: System MUST persist all saved notes between application sessions
- **FR-004**: System MUST display all notes in reverse chronological order (newest first)
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide immediate visual feedback when user saves or attempts to save a note
- **FR-006**: System MUST display the complete list of saved notes on the main screen
- **FR-007**: System MUST automatically timestamp each note upon creation
- **FR-008**: System MUST prevent creation of duplicate notes with identical title and content
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle gracefully when no notes exist (empty state)
- **FR-010**: System MUST maintain responsive performance regardless of number of stored notes

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: Note creation and display MUST feel instant (under 200ms response time per constitution)
- **NFR-002**: User interface MUST be minimal and uncluttered (constitutional constraint)
- **NFR-003**: Application MUST work offline without internet connectivity
- **NFR-004**: Application MUST be responsive across different screen sizes

### Key Entities
- **Note**: Represents a user's written note containing a title (string), content (string), and creation timestamp (datetime). Notes are uniquely identified by their combination of title, content, and timestamp.
